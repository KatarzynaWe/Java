2. Write a method that takes an array of numbers that returns an array with the same elements in reverse order - [solution](https://github.com/KatarzynaWe/java/blob/master/ReversedArray.java)
3. Write a method that will return a String [] array containing the first 'x' letters of the alphabet - [solution](https://github.com/KatarzynaWe/java/blob/master/Alphabet.java)
4. Create the Figure interface. The interface should contain the methods getPerimeter (returning a perimeter) and getArea (returning an area). Then create the Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle classes, each class implement the Figure interface. Write a program that will download from the user: the circle radius, 2 lengths of the sides of the triangle, the length of the sides of the rectangle.
Create instances of these objects and place them in the Figure [] array. Then, iterating through the objects, display the area and perimeter of the current object. - [solution](https://github.com/KatarzynaWe/java/tree/master/figures)
